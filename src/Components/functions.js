        At Abtion, we focus on delivering value to our clients.
        Our way of working is heavily inspired by eXtreme
        Programming. By doing that, our developers get all the
        necessary context to make the right decisions. We talk
        daily with our clients and debate solutions in teams.

        teams, and clients. It's OK if you have a preferred
        technology stack, but you must be ready to expand it.
